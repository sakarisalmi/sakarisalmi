Hello dear reader!

I am an up-and-coming programmer that is currently studying at the Hive coding school in Helsinki, Finland.

I was bitten by the coding-bug when I was studying history in University. I minored in computer science, and found programming so fun and interesting that I decided to make a career change. Through an acquaintance I learned of Hive, and so I gave it a go and got in! Hive is very hands-on, and the nature of the school (no teachers here; it's all about peer-to-peer evaluations, baby), teaches one to take initiative and work in a group. I would recommend Hive (or any of the 42-schools) to anyone who has even the slightest of interest in coding!

My general intrests are history (my master's thesis is still in the works; if in the unlikely chance you are in need for an expert in the subject of local letters that deal with beggars during the Great Finnish Famine of 1866-1868, I'm your guy!) and coding of course!

This is my humble github-profile. It is in quite an early stage, but no worries, I will be adding a lot of projects here in the future.

But please, check out my projects and enjoy!
