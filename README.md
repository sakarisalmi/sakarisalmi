Hello dear reader!

I am an up-and-coming programmer that is currently studying at the Hive coding school in Helsinki, Finland. My general intrests are history (my master's thesis is in the works; if in the unlikely chance you are in need for an expert in the subject of local letters that deal with beggars during the Great Finnish Famine of 1866-1868, I'm you're guy!), gaming and, of course, coding!

This is my humble github-profile. It is in quite an early stage, but no worries, I will be adding a lot of projects here in the future.

But please, check out my projects and enjoy!
